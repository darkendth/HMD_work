Each principal component is a linear combination of the original features, and the coefficients of this linear combination, also known as loadings, indicate the contribution of each original feature to the principal component.

	The loadings can be used to determine which original features are most strongly correlated with each principal component. If a particular original feature has a high loading value for a principal component, it indicates that this feature has a strong influence on that principal component. Conversely, if a particular original feature has a low loading value for a principal component, it indicates that this feature has a weak influence on that principal component.

	Furthermore, the variance explained by each principal component can be used to determine the overall importance of each original feature. Original features that have a high contribution to the principal components that explain most of the variance in the data are considered more important than those that have a low contribution.

	In summary, the loadings and variance explained by each principal component obtained from PCA can be used to identify the correlation of the original features with the PCA output. This information can be useful for understanding which original features are most important for the overall structure of the data and can help with further analysis or feature selection.
